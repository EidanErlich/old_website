							<p> As part of a team, we set out to design and fabricate an electric go-kart using tools and materials that were readily available for us.
                                I took the lead on fully designing the go-kart using CAD, and then I fabricated the components using machine shop and power tools. We utilized scrap metal found in the shop, along with leftover materials from previous projects, to construct our Go-Kart. This approach not only allowed us to save on costs, but it also gave us the opportunity to recycle and repurpose materials that would have otherwise gone to waste as well as making the most out of limited resources.
                                My partner and I conceptualized the electric Go-Kart by brainstorming ideas, sketching designs, and creating CAD mock-ups. We then pitched the project to our school, securing the funding needed to bring our vision to life. Despite the challenges presented by tight budgetary and deadlines requirements, we were determined to complete the project successfully.
                                I selected and sourced key components such as motor controllers, batteries, and mechanical modules, all while staying within budget. Next, I integrated the electronic controls with the custom powertrain, optimizing the power-to-weight ratio, and increasing power by 150%. This allowed the go-kart to reach high speeds with ease and maneuverability. The final product was a sleek, albeit scrappy, electric go-kart that was ready to take on the track.
                                The project was a great success, and it was extremely satisfying to see our hard work come to life in such a spectacular way. The go-kart was a functional and stylish mode of transportation. It was a great experience to work on a project that brought together my passion for engineering and my love for motorsports, and I am proud of the final product.
