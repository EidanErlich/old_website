							<p> As a candidate for a BASc in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I bring a unique combination of technical skills and project management experience to any role. My expertise in research and development, project management, and strategic analysis has been honed through various professional experiences and extracurricular activities.
								My technical skills include experience with OOP and machine vision in C++, automation and machine learning in Python, and optimization in Excel with Microsoft Azure datasets. I am also experienced in CAD using SolidWorks and AutoCAD, and in manufacturing using 3D printing and with machine shop tools. These skills have been showcased in various projects, such as the Toyota Innovation Challenge, where I developed an autonomous machine vision algorithm within a simulated manufacturing environment, and my Chess Robot Project, where I conceptualized, designed, and constructed a chess-playing robot. 
								I am also skilled in technical writing and communication, with experience using MS Suite to convey complex ideas in a professional manner. This skill has been demonstrated in my professional experience, where I authored technical analysis reports and drafted legal documents.
								I am excited to bring my unique blend of technical skills and project management experience to any role and look forward to contributing to the success of the organization.
								Seeking a challenging and dynamic role in R&D project management that will allow me to use my expertise in OOP and machine vision, automation and machine learning, and CAD design to drive cost reduction and efficiency.

								Oh I also love to snowboard and mountain bike!
