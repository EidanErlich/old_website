							<p>One of my notable projects was utilizing python to predict home prices. To accomplish this, I trained two supervised machine learning models by analyzing metrics from public datasets. The goal of this project was to achieve a high level of precision in predicting house prices.
                                I first used a decision tee model to predict the prices. To optimize the decision tree depth, I utilized mean absolute error and cross-validation trade-off. This helped me to maximize the model's accuracy. This approach allowed me to identify the most optimal depth, right in between overfitting and underfitting the data. Additionally, I trained and fitted a random forest model to the data. When comparing the random forest model to the decision tree model, the random forest was more accurate.
                                One of the key challenges in this project was finding the right dataset and features that have a strong correlation with house prices. I cleaned and preprocessed the data using feature selection techniques like variance threshold to select the most relevant features.
                                To train the models, I used the selected features as inputs to the models and the house prices as the target variable. I used different evaluation metrics like mean squared error, and mean absolute error to evaluate the performance of the models. The random forest model performed better on the test dataset, which gave me an accuracy of +/- 15% compared to the 25% from the decision tree algorithm. 
                                In summary, the project demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and model evaluation. It also showed my proficiency in python programming and the use of machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.
